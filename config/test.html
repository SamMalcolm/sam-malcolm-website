<p>This week I spent my train trips re building the Lynda course page user interface in React JS. Why you might ask,
	well, its a really good UI. It offers a comprehensive overview of the course, an innovative interactive transcript
	which is great for accessibility and just a sleek mobile friendly layout.</p>
<p>I built this in React because my website is built in React and I’m hoping to soon create some tutorial videos or
	series of videos as I think it might be something I’m good at. Plus, I’ve gotten a lot of knowledge from the online
	community for free, and because I have skills to teach and some production skills, I’m in a spot where I can give
	back to that online community. My first series I’m planning to do is to build the front end app I experimented with
	this year ‘Rankster’ you can see this in the works page. It has some actually cool stuff going on and is pretty
	much stepping the user through a sorting algorithm, there’s also some recursion in there it was actually a
	deceptively interesting thing to figure out. Who knows what I will make really, and honestly If the community asks
	for something, ill try and make it.</p>
<p>Heres some things I learnt rebuilding the Lynda UI. I learnt that there is a somewhat hidden from their documentation
	Google API endpoint that returns the transcript in XML form. It seems like an old endpoint and smells of future
	decommissioning, but I hope not, because it provides the exact data I need to built the interactive transcript
	layer in a fairly useable format, although XML is a bit old these days.  The second thing is, when will I ever
	learn not to mutate the state in React. Even when I knowingly try not to do it I seem to fall for that same gotcha,
	fooled me twice, shame on me. Shall not fool me again! Its important to remember to not assign a new variable to
	the current state because its not actually copying the data across just creating a new alias for it. The method
	suggested to me on Stack Overflow (bless them) is to use the map method and loop through the items in the array and
	simply return them to rebuild the same object.</p>
<p>So DO NOT do this:</p>
<pre>
	let tcopy = transcript;
</pre>
<p>Do this instead:</p>
<pre>
	let tcopy = transcript.map((script) => {
		return script
	});
</pre>
<p>I also learnt more about the YouTube iframe API, and that in a single page application you need to call the
	methods that their script call when the API is ready yourself if you are revisiting a page with the API present.
	When
	the YouTube script loads it calls a method called onYouTubeIframeAPIReady(); But because react is a single page
	application, you need to realise that the YouTube scripts will still be ‘ready’ from when React first put them in
	the
	DOM. So you need to check the if the script there and if it is, inject it and it will call the methods, if not
	simply
	call the methods yourself, like this:</p>
<pre>
	if (!document.querySelector("script[src=\"https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api\"]")) {
		var tag = document.createElement('script');
		tag.src = "https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api";
		var firstScriptTag = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
		firstScriptTag.parentNode.insertBefore(tag, firstScriptTag);
	} else {
		onYouTubeIframeAPIReady();
		onPlayerReady();
	}
	</pre>
